## Technologies
I developed the full echosystem of the app, backend and frontend.

For backend I have employed Laravel (8.83.27). The User's login is managed via Sanctum

For frontend I have used React Native (0.70.6). To manage the state I have used React-Redux (8.0.5) and Redux(4.2.0). Another tools from npm packages are: react-native-image-picker (to take pictures from the camera or device), react-native-vector-icons(icons of the app), react-native-async-storage/async-storage (to store the user). The app is designed and structured implementing Atomic Design.
